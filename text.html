        <p>So... I’ve been thinking a lot lately, and I don’t really know how to say this, but here it goes. I love you, I really do. But at the same time, I feel like we’re both kinda too young and clueless to really understand what love is supposed to be. It’s like, we’re still figuring ourselves out, you know?</p>

        <p>I’m not saying my feelings aren’t real, because they are. But I think we’re both still growing and changing so much, and maybe we’re not ready for something as serious as love right now. It sucks because I care about you so much, but I don’t want us to rush into something that we’re not mature enough to handle yet.</p>

        <p>I don’t even know if I’m making sense right now, but I just needed to be honest. This hurts to say, and I hate that it might hurt you, but maybe we need time to grow on our own before we can really figure out what we want.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry if this is a lot, but I hope you get where I’m coming from.</p>
